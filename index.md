# Characterizing Social Insider Attacks on Facebook

## Abstract
Facebook accounts are secured against unauthorized access through passwords and device-level security. Those defenses, however, may not be sufficient to prevent **social insider attacks**, where attackers know their victims, and gain access to a victim's account by interacting directly with their device. To characterize these attacks, we ran two MTurk studies. In the first (n = 1,308), using the list experiment method, we estimated that 24% of participants had perpetrated social insider attacks and that 21% had been victims (and knew about it). In the second study (n = 45), participants wrote stories detailing personal experiences with such attacks. Using thematic analysis, we typified attacks around five motivations (fun, curiosity, jealousy, animosity, and utility), and explored dimensions associated with each type. Our combined findings indicate that social insider attacks are common, often have serious emotional consequences, and have no simple mitigation.

## Study Material and Design

A complete list of survey material can be downloaded [here.]({{ site.url }}/study_data/survey_material.pdf)

## Study 1: Prevalence of Social Insider Attack on Facebook

We conducted a list experiment to explore the prevalence of social insider attacks on Facebook.

### Pilot Study

First, we performed a pilot for item selection. Raw data (with exclusion criteria, details in the paper) can be downloaded [here.]({{ site.url }}/study_data/prevalencestudy_pilot_responses_exclusion_with_time.csv)

### Prevalence Study

We had 2 treatment groups and 1 control group for the list experiment.

Control group's raw results (after filtering) can be accessed [here.]({{ site.url }}/study_data/prevalencestudy_control_filtered_responses.csv)

Treatment group 1 (referenced in the paper as Treatment P) was the list experiment where the sensitive statement was for **perpetrators** of social insider attacks. Raw results (after filtering) can be accessed [here.]({{ site.url }}/study_data/prevalencestudy_treatment1_filtered_responses.csv) 

Treatment group 2 (referenced in the paper as Treatment V) was the list experiment where the sensitive statement was for **victims** of social insider attacks. Raw results (after filtering) can be accessed [here.]({{ site.url }}/study_data/prevalencestudy_treatment2_filtered_responses.csv)
